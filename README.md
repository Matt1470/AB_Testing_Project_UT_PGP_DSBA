# E-New Express Analysis

## Overview
This project involves **A/B testing** for a new landing page of the news website, **E-New Express**. The primary goal was to determine whether the new landing page design led to an increase in the time users spent on the site compared to the old landing page. The analysis uses statistical techniques to validate the effectiveness of the new design.

## Motivation
With the ever-growing competition in the digital news industry, user engagement is critical to retaining readership. **E-New Express** wanted to test whether redesigning its landing page could encourage users to spend more time on the website. This project was created to:
- Analyze the impact of the new landing page using A/B testing.
- Provide actionable insights on user behavior to support data-driven decisions.

## Tools and Technologies
The project was implemented using the following tools and libraries:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, Numpy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Statistical Testing**: Built-in Python libraries for hypothesis testing

## Key Features
- **A/B Testing Setup**:
  - Segmented users into two groups: one viewing the old landing page and the other viewing the new landing page.
  - Analyzed user engagement metrics (e.g., time spent on the site).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
  - Visualized the distribution of time spent for both groups using histograms and box plots.
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Defined null and alternative hypotheses.
  - Conducted statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to determine the significance of observed differences in user behavior.
- **Visualization**:
  - Compared time spent using clear and concise visuals such as bar charts and box plots.

> *Note*: The dataset used in this analysis was either fictional or anonymized to protect user privacy.

## Analysis and Results
### Hypotheses:
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is no difference in the time users spend on the old and new landing pages.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Users spend more time on the new landing page compared to the old one.

### Key Findings:
1. The average time spent on the new landing page was higher than the old landing page.
2. Statistical testing (e.g., t-tests) revealed that the difference was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05), supporting the alternative hypothesis.
3. Visualizations demonstrated clear trends in user engagement favoring the new design.
